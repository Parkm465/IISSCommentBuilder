# Intensive Individualized Support Systems Comment Builder
A Java application, built to improve efficiency and decrease the repetitiveness of creating comments for my Health Technician Assistant position where I would record the activities and progress made with clients.

The application would store comments user creates, pastes notes into a box, and copys the full comment to the user's clipboard where it would be able to be pasted into a data management website.

One of the major challenges that I dealt with was debugging MySQL Workshop. I wasn't able to login to my database, so I ended up having to do find relevant information for several days and tried implementing several solutions, before I ended up solving the problem by changing the password on my terminal.
